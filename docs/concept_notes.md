# Concept Notes — SleepSense Project

### 1. Problem Motivation
Modern Indian urban life has disrupted sleep cycles due to long work hours, screen dependency, and environmental pollution. Measuring sleep quality through wearable devices is expensive, so SleepSense provides a **data-driven estimation** using simple lifestyle and environmental inputs.

### 2. Objective
To design a regression model that predicts **sleep_quality_score (0–100)** using lifestyle and environment data, enabling users to understand and improve their sleep health.

### 3. Core Concepts Covered
| Concept | Description | Implemented In |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Supervised Learning** | Regression model trained on labeled data | Notebook 04 |
| **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** | Data profiling, visualization, correlations | Notebook 01 |
| **Feature Engineering** | Derived sleep deficit, digital fatigue, environment stress | Notebook 03 |
| **Regularization (Ridge/Lasso)** | Penalizes large coefficients to reduce overfitting | Notebook 06 |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | R², RMSE, MAE, Adjusted R² | Notebook 05 |
| **Deployment (Streamlit)** | Interactive multilingual app | App folder |

### 4. Model Selection
Three models were trained and compared:
- Linear Regression (base model)
- Ridge Regression (selected)
- Lasso Regression (feature reduction)
  
**Ridge Regression** gave balanced bias–variance performance and interpretable coefficients.

### 5. Deployment Summary
The model and scaler were serialized using `joblib` and integrated into a Streamlit app with full **language selection, visual analytics, yoga recommendations,** and **motivational quotes**.  
Users can input values such as:
- Avg Sleep Hours
- Screen Time
- Stress Level
- Physical Activity
- City Noise
- AQI  
and instantly receive their predicted sleep score and lifestyle guidance.

### 6. Educational Value
- Demonstrates real ML workflow.
- Combines statistics, psychology, and lifestyle science.
- Encourages awareness of sleep health through AI.

### 7. Key Takeaways
- Simple linear models can yield useful lifestyle predictions when engineered well.  
- Multilingual deployment adds inclusivity and UX value.  
- Interpretability builds trust — explaining “why” predictions happen is as important as “what”.
